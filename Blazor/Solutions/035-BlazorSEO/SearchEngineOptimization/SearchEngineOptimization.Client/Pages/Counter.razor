@page "/counter"
@* 
    Here we use Server Mode, and we have not disabled prerendering, which is active by default.

    This means that the page will be prerendered on the server (just like with SSR)
    and then sent to the client. Afterwards, interactivity will be possible through a WebSocket.

    In a case like this, where we are not fetching data, (which would make an annoying flickering on the screen)
    this is the ideal approach. The user will not notice the page is prerendered, and the page will be interactive afterwards.
    This gives the best of both worlds in terms of Search Engine Optimization and interactivity.

    The principle here is the exact same with Blazor WebAssembly.
